            <h2 id="1">What is an element?</h2>
            <p>An element is a substance that cannot be refined or purified
                into simpler ingredients. Elements are made of building
                blocks called atoms and each element has its own unique
                set of atoms. Everything in the Universe is made from
                elements, either in their pure form, or combined together
                to make new substances called compounds.</p>
            <h3>Classical elements</h3>
            <img src="images/classical elements.jpg" alt="classical elements">
            <p>The idea of an element is very old. In
                ancient cultures, people believed that all
                things were made from mixtures of just
                four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
                They thought that hot and dry things
                contained fire and air, while cold and
                wet things were made of earth and water.</p>
            <h3>Modern elements</h3>
            <p>The scientific study of the properties and
                reactions of elements is called chemistry.
                This has found that there are at least 118
                elements. Most elements are created inside a
                star or in a supernova – the explosive ending
                of a big star’s life. Scientists have also been able
                to create the heaviest elements in laboratories.</p>
            <p>The Crab Nebula, the remains of
                a supernova, is rich in hydrogen.</p>

            <h2 id="2">Types of element</h2>
            <p>Atoms are made of smaller “subatomic” particles called
                protons, electrons, and neutrons. The properties of an element
                depend on how these particles are arranged. Elements with
                the same number of electrons in the outermost shell of their
                atom have similar physical and chemical properties. Metals
                mostly have one or two outer electrons, semi-metals have
                three or four, and non-metals have up to eight. </p>

            <h2 id="3">Building blocks</h2>
            <p>Everything in the Universe is
                made up of the many types
                of element arranged in different
                combinations. That includes
                living things such as humans.
                The human body is made of
                60 different elements. Just six
                of them make up 99 per cent of
                the body’s weight, while the
                other 54 make up the remaining
                1 per cent. Amazingly
                only three elements make up
                most of Earth’s atmosphere.</p>

            <h2 id="4">States of matter</h2>
            <p>Every element has a standard state – solid, liquid, or gas –
                at room temperature. The atoms of a solid fit together in
                a tight-knit pattern, while in a liquid the atoms are loosely
                connected so they flow around. In a gas, the atoms are
                free of each other and disperse easily. Applying heat can
                change the state of an element from solid to liquid, and
                then to gas, or even from solid to gas in some cases.</p>
